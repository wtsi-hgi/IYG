The usage of a range of years within a copyright statement contained within 
this distribution should be interpreted as being equivalent to a list of years 
including the first and last year specified and all consecutive years between 
them. For example, a copyright statement that reads 'Copyright (c) 2005, 2007-
2009, 2011-2012' should be interpreted as being identical to a statement that 
reads 'Copyright (c) 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012' and a copyright 
statement that reads "Copyright (c) 2005-2012' should be interpreted as being 
identical to a statement that reads 'Copyright (c) 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 
2009, 2010, 2011, 2012'."
