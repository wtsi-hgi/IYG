A	<p>Your Y chromosome comes from haplogroup A. This haplogroup is almost exclusive to Africa, and represents the oldest haplogroup division: it split off from other human haplogroups over 100,000 years ago, long before humans left Africa. </p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_A_%28Y-DNA%29">Read more about haplogroup A on wikipedia.</a> </p>
C	<p>You have a Y chromosome from Haplogroup C. Y haplogroup C is found in Central Asia, East Asia, South East Asia, Oceania and American Indians. It is perhaps best well known as haplogroup that Genghis Khan is believed to have had (any passed on to his many sons). </p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_C_%28Y-DNA%29">Read more about haplogroup C on wikipedia</a>.</p>
I	<p>You have a Y chromosome from Haplogroup C. Haplogroup I is found throughout Europe and Western Asia, and is particularly common in Scandinavia and the Balkans. It arose around the same time of the last glacial maximum, and its distribution may be related to the expansion of European populations as the ice began to recede. </p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_I_%28Y-DNA%29">Read more about haplogroup I on wikipedia</a>.</p>
J	<p>You have a Y chromosome from Haplogroup J. This haplogroup is common in the Middle East, North Africa and around the mediterranean. The expansion of this haplogroup is believed to have occurred around ten thousand years ago, perhaps at the the time same time as the domestication of livestock in the Middle East. </p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_J_%28Y-DNA%29">Read more about haplogroup J on wikipedia</a></p>.
R1a	<p> You have a Y chromosome from Haplogroup R1b. This widely distributed haplogroup is common all the way from Central Europe, through Siberia and down to Southern Asia. This wide distribution has led to wide debates about its origin, with some proposing that it was driven by Western migration from Southern Asia (and associated with the rise of Indo-European languages), while others suggest that it may be due to more recent migration from the Eurasian Steppe. </p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R1a_%28Y-DNA%29">Read more about haplogroup R1a on wikipedia.</a> </p>
R1b	<p>You have a Y chromosome from Haplogroup R1b. This is the most common haplogroup in Europeans, and is particularly common in Western Europe. It is also found in a few other non-European locations, including Nigeria and Cameroon, and .  Despite its high frequency in Europe, R1b appears to have arisen in Western Asia, and may have spread through Europe with the rise of farming. </p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R1b_%28Y-DNA%29">Read more about haplogroup R1b on wikipedia</a></p>.
R?	<p>You are a member of the large haplogroup R, a haplogroup that is common throughout Asia and Europe. We have attempted to add resolution to this extensive haplogroup, but in your case the assays failed and we thus unfortunately cannot give you any further information. </p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R_(Y-DNA)">You can read about all the difference possible R groups you could belong to on Wikipedia.</a></p>
R	<p>You are a member of the large haplogroup R. However, you do not appear to be belong to either of the common R haplogroups, R1a and R1b. You most likely to belong to haplogroup R2, a haplogroup most common in South and Southern Asian. However, you may belong to R1*, a rare haplogroup present mostly in individuals of persian ancestry.</p><p> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R_(Y-DNA)">Read more about haplogroup R and its many subclades on wikipedia.</a></p>
BDE	<p>Our genotyping test was not able to uniquely determine your haplogroup. However, we can say that your Y chromosome is either a member of the very old Africa haplogroup B, or the large haplogroup DE. The former is found particularly in the forested regions of Central-Western Africa, and the latter is made up of the East Asian haplogroup D and the common African haplogroup E.</p><p>Read more about both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_B_%28Y-DNA%29">haplogroup B</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_DE_%28Y-DNA%29">haplogroup DE</a> on wikipedia.</p>
Ambig1	<p>You are not a member of any of the Y haplogroups that our assay was designed to detect. We can tell you that you are not a member of haplogroups A, B, C, D, E, I, J or R!</p><p> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Y-chromosome_DNA_haplogroup">Read more about what haplogroups you could belong to on wikipedia</a></p>
Ambig2	<p>Unfortunately, the genotyping assay failed for your DNA on a few key variants, so we cannot give an accurate Y chromosome haplogroup assignment. However, you can see more detail for the variants that we did manage to genotype below.</p>
Unknown	<p>There was not enough Y chromosome DNA in your sample to determine your haplogroup. Perhaps you don't have a Y chromosome?</p>
