=head1 NAME

dump.pl: Dump a text file of SNP call results for a particular user.

=head1 ADDRESS

_HOST_/traits

=head1 PURPOSE

For either a valid decrypted barcode, or valid public_id (a hashed and salted
version of the barcode used to avoid passing either the bardcode or the
auto-incrementing primary key around the application), this script will load
and output a file containing all the SNPs for which this user has a result for.


=head1 EXPECTED INPUTS

The script expects the following POST variables:

=over

=item * [barcode|profile]

Either an encrypted barcode submission, or a public_id.
If neither key resolves to a user in the database, the user will be returned
to the login view and instructed to try again.
