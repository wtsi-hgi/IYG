=head1 NAME

traits.pl: Display a list of traits and their results for a particular user.

=head1 ADDRESS

_HOST_/traits

=head1 PURPOSE

For either a valid decrypted barcode, or valid public_id (a hashed and salted
version of the barcode used to avoid passing either the bardcode or the
auto-incrementing primary key around the application), this script will load
and render all the traits for which this user has at least one SNP result for.

For each trait, a button will allow a user to view a breakdown of the SNP
calls that affect this trait.

=head1 EXPECTED INPUTS

The script expects the following POST variables:

=over

=item * [barcode|profile]

Either an encrypted barcode submission, or a public_id.
If neither key resolves to a user in the database, the user will be returned
to the login view and instructed to try again.

=back

=head1 TEMPLATE

/templates/traits_list.tmpl
