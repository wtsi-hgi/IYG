=head1 NAME

results/index.pl: Default trait results "handler"

=head1 ADDRESS

_HOST_/results/[index]

=head1 PURPOSE

Loads all data pertaining to SNPs that have an effect on this trait and
renders them with the default trait results template; displaying the trait
name and description and a "SNP box" for each SNP detailing the possible
genotypes and frequenies, and a "population bar" showing the user's frequency
compared to the rest of the sample.

=head1 EXPECTED INPUTS

The script expects the following POST variables:

=over

=item * profile

The public_id of the current user. Failure to provide this will cause the script
to load the login template.

=item * trait

The trait_id for the trait to be viewed.

=back

=head1 TEMPLATE

/templates/results/default.tmpl
